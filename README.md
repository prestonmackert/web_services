Looking at "big tech"

## Bible App
This is a small menu-driven python application that can be used to teach data structures, basic search, and how to leverage AWS compute infrastructure.

The original Greek text of the new testament is was formatted nicely and allows us to teach basic file reading and data structures in python. We then take that text and show off the AWS translation API by searching for a verse to translate in the app.

I added the Quran as english text (harder to find a plain text file that is nicely formatted... original arabic would require image recognition so I stuck with an english translation that I found). I left the function of 'creating the quran' as just formatting the surahs... cause the text file is formatted grossly.

### ToDo
implement more AWS support functions, namely storage manipulation and comprehend services with our available text.
